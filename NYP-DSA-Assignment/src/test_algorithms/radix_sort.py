    Do a radix sort (base 10) on the database by integer.
    
    Radix sort is a type of non-comparison sort which is different from most sorting algorithms 
    and uses the counting sort algorithm but solves the issue of 
    counting sortâ€™s space complexity of O(n+k) where k is the largest number in the array 
    to O(n+b) where b is the base number 10.
    
    Its time complexity is linear in nature which can be significantly faster than other sorting
    algorithms for larger arrays, but it is also slower for smaller arrays.
    
    Requires 2 arguments:
    - arr (list): The array of elements to sort by integer
    - reverse (bool): True if the list is to be sorted in descending order (Default: False)
    
    Best time complexity: O(d(n+b))
    Worst time complexity: O(d(n+b))
    Average time complexity: O(d(n+b))
    where d is the number of digits in the largest number
    and b is the base number, 10.
